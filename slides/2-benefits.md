  <p><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>: Enables continuous delivery of code while keeping unfinished features hidden from end-users.</p>
  <p><strong>Testing in Production</strong>: Allows testing of new features with a subset of users in a live environment.</p>
  <p><strong>Rollback Capability</strong>: Facilitates quick rollbacks by turning off a problematic feature without the need for a full deployment.</p>
  <p><strong>Reduced Risk</strong>: Safely test new features before fully releasing them to the entire user base.</p>
